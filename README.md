## About me

Driven by a genuine passion for technology and innovation, I am constantly seeking to expand my knowledge—currently diving deeper into Machine Learning to strengthen my technical foundation and deliver impactful solutions.

With a robust background in Artificial Intelligence and process optimization, I excel at bridging the gap between business and technology. I have a proven track record of leading cross-functional teams, gathering requirements, and delivering automated solutions that drive measurable operational efficiency and business value.

My hands-on experience includes developing and deploying Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects—ranging from time series forecasting and classification to neural network modeling—using tools such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras. I am skilled in predictive analytics, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering, and I actively maintain GitHub repositories to validate and share practical knowledge.

I am particularly interested in MLOps and cloud-based model deployment (AWS SageMaker, Flink, S3), always seeking to connect cutting-edge technology with strategic business needs.

    <a href="https://github.com/Batista94/dc_previsao_vendas_etanol" target="_blank">Ethanol Sales Forecasting</a> - 
    <b>Time series forecasting for ethanol sales in Southeast Brazil.</b>
    <br>
    This project was developed as part of my MBA thesis in Artificial Intelligence and Big Data at ICMC-USP. It applies advanced Machine Learning techniques to predict ethanol sales, considering the complexities of the sugarcane agribusiness sector.
    <br>
    <b>Key Features:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Comprehensive dataset covering production, capacity, and ethanol sales from 2019 to 2023.</li>
      <li>Advanced data preprocessing: cubic interpolation for missing values, normalization, and outlier treatment.</li>
      <li>Comparison of predictive models: ARIMA, SARIMA, XGBoost, and Prophet.</li>
      <li>Time series cross-validation with expanding window validation.</li>
      <li>XGBoost outperformed traditional time series models, providing more accurate forecasts.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/Batista94/nlp_disaster_tweets_kaggle" target="_blank">Disaster Tweets Sentiment Analysis</a> - 
    <b>Sentiment analysis using DistilBERT for disaster-related tweets.</b>
    <br>
    This NLP project classifies tweets as either related or not related to real disasters. It is based on the Kaggle competition "NLP with Disaster Tweets."
    <br>
    <b>Key Features:</b>
